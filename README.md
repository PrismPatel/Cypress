# 🌱 Cypress Connect – Citizen Issue Reporting System  
Software Development Life Cycle Project
## 📌 Project Overview  
Cypress Connect is a web-based system that enables citizens to report and track street-related issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, or blocked sidewalks. The goal is to improve transparency between the public and municipal teams by providing real-time updates, duplicate detection, and clear resolution workflows.  

This project was developed as part of an academic **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** course, following **Agile methodologies** with iterative sprints.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Location-Based Reporting** – Submit issues tied to specific locations.  
- **Issue Categorization** – Report problems under categories (e.g., potholes, lights, garbage).  
- **Duplicate Detection** – Prevent multiple submissions for the same issue.  
- **Status Notifications** – Citizens receive updates as issues progress.  
- **Administrative Dashboard** – City staff can view, assign, and close tickets.

## 👨‍💻 My Role  
As **Team Lead**, I guided the project through all SDLC phases:  
- **Requirements Gathering** – Wrote user stories, identified dependencies, and documented requirements.  
- **System Design** – Created use case diagrams, workflows, and process flows.  
- **Agile Project Management** – Planned and managed sprints, maintained the backlog, facilitated sprint reviews.  
- **Development & Testing** – Oversaw implementation, wrote test cases, and coordinated testing cycles.  
- **Deployment** – Managed transition from testing to deployment with proper documentation.

## 📖 Lessons Learned  
- Managing a project through **Agile SDLC phases** (development, testing, deployment).  
- The importance of clear documentation (user stories, use cases, workflows).  
- Balancing **team leadership** with hands-on development.  
- Designing solutions that are both **citizen-friendly** and **administrator-friendly**.
